public class InvertedIndex {
    /*
        Constructor -> doesn't take any argument

        Algorithm for populating the invertedIndex -> 1) Split document to words, then add each word to the inverted index, and the document which the word occurs in, in the hashset of documents
                                                      2) Also while we are inserting a word, we also update the count of the number of times the given word has occurred in the wordCountInDoc

        Algorithm for fullSearch -> 1) Retrieve the set of documents which have the given word
                                    2) Get count of number of times the word has appeared in the document
                                    3) Store the count and docId in a treeMap with the count being the id
                                    4) Traverse the treeMap in reverse order and keep adding the documents to the arrayList
                                    5) Return the arrayList

        Algorithm for partialSearch -> 1) For every key in inverted index, if the key contains the word, store the document in a set
                                       2) Return the set of documents. Since we do not need to implement sorting, this is enough.
